PURPOSE: Analyze any potential factors that are causing internet disparities across the United States. 
In this project, we dive into five variables of interest based on a dataset of about 800 different 
regions. 

WORK: Research Question, Linear Regression Methods, Plotting the Scatterplots with Least Squares 
Regression Line and Highlighted Outliers, Results, Significance Tests and Analysis, 
Conclusion and Discussion.

MOTIVATION: Despite being in such a developed country such as the United States, there are still
disparities that are not attended to. This project aims to analyze potential factors causing this
and shine light to further educate the population on this issue. This will hopefully serve as a 
foundation to eventually scrutinize and help other countries that are not as developed.
